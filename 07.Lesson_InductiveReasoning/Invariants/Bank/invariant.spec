/**
 * This rule is intended to check that the Bank always returns the user's
 * funds, even if we consider examples where the call to `withdraw` reverts.
 *
 * If `withdraw` does revert, the user's ETH balance will not change, so the
 * rule will fail.
 *
 * This rule does fail because there are lots of uninteresting ways for a
 * function to revert.  For example, a non-payable method will revert if the
 * `msg.value` is nonzero.
 *
 * There are also interesting ways for `withdraw` to revert.  In particular, if
 * the bank gets hacked, it may not _have_ the ETH to return to the user, so
 * the call to `send` would fail.  See `README.md` for a discussion on how to
 * ignore the uninteresting cases and still catch the interesting cases.
 *
 * @dev The `@withrevert` annotation on the call to `withdraw` instructs the
 *      Prover to consider reverting calls, which are ignored by default.
